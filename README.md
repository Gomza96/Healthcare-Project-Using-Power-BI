# Patient Care Insights and Improvements - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI project visualizes key insights related to patient care, including patient admissions, doctor feedback, patient attendance, diagnosis breakdown, and insurance coverage. It highlights areas for improvement, offering actionable recommendations to optimize healthcare delivery and resources.

## Key Insights
- **Patient Admissions**: Private rooms are the most preferred, while ICU and General Wards have smaller shares.
- **Doctor Feedback**: 57% of patients rate their doctors highly, with some room for improvement in communication and care quality.
- **Patient Attendance**: Seven doctors manage around 1,000 patients each, showing efficiency but possible physician overburdening.
- **Diagnosis Breakdown**: Viral infections are the most common diagnosis, while fractures make up only 14.7% of cases.
- **Insurance vs Billing**: Most diagnoses are covered by insurance, though flu cases have billing amounts exceeding coverage.

## Improvement Areas
- **Admissions**: Optimize the use of ICU, General Wards, and Private Rooms to improve patient care and resource allocation.
- **Doctor Feedback**: Address lower feedback ratings by enhancing communication and care quality.
- **Workload**: Balance physician workload to avoid burnout and ensure consistent care quality.
- **Diagnosis**: Focus on addressing viral infections and enhancing trauma care services.
- **Insurance**: Adjust insurance coverage, especially for flu cases, and educate patients about their insurance options.

## Features
- **Doughnut Chart**: Displays patient feedback for doctors, showing the distribution of ratings.
- **Bar Graph**: Highlights patient attendance metrics per physician, with data on the number of patients attended.
- **Funnel Chart**: Illustrates the breakdown of diagnoses by type, with viral infections topping the chart.
- **Line Graph**: Compares billing amounts with insurance coverage, with a focus on flu cases as an outlier.
